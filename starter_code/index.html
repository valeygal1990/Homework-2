<!-- 
	Hi Valentine!  I added feedback about your code in HTML comments like this one.

	Overall, great job!  The page looks just like the design file and your code is very neat,
	organized, and well indented, which makes it very easy for me to follow.

	Another overall comment - I noticed you did not use the <nav> tag in here.  I completely understand
	why - there is no obvious navigation (though you could make the case that the social media icons are
	a "navigation" to the links to those site).  I just wanted to make sure you are aware of the <nav> tag
	for future projects that have a more obvious navigation.

	More comments below!

					Since this "Get it now" button would probably go to another page, this should be
					an <a> tag instead.  You can always style <a> tags to look like <button> tags, though
					I completely get why you chose the <button> tag here.  This wasn't particularly clear
					in the design file, so don't worry about it too much in this case, but something to
					think about for future projects.

				<div> tags are totally fine here, but it is more semantically correct to use something
				like the <section> tag instead, since these blocks of stuff on the page are more like
				sections of the page.  The <div> tag is usually used when no other HTML5 tags make sense -
				kind of like the "other" category in surveys.
